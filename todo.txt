bugs:
callback on color picker input isnt called if another color changes its color

favorites modal
***history modal
download history option
download and upload favorites option
preview modal to display text on color, color on text, color on color etc, against black, white, and other colors
div that displys formulas
link to color convert library on github and this repo on github
setting for dark theme, fullscreen, donate button? link to repo?
transparency/alpha option?
type your color or color name/detect color?
get color name from json?
favorites list you can name them and edit them, search by name, sort by name or date

color names here for detect color: https://github.com/bahamas10/css-color-names/blob/master/css-color-names.json
user input delete spaces to lowercase
look for #, rgb, hsl, hsv, hsb, cmyk

modal for list of all 140 color names?

make js library for converting and test
make js file for updating display with certain color
make driver/main js file for controlling change of inputs, calling converter and display files

modal for info on color models
modal for css to copy (dropdown for color mode (rgb, hsl, hex), checkbox for !important, and display color, backgorund-color, border-color, with copy buttons next to each)
modal for lighter/darker colors and vary by saturation too
palettes?

add more color names?
combine detect color and color picker inputs into one, fix typing color names into color-picker input resulting in NAN

use angular to make code simpler
