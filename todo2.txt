TODO
organize js and css files

look into colors being slightly different and getting adjusted by setColor()

test history/favorites more

look into bugs with color picker not updating (text color and inputs, callback func)

work on info about color modes next (or convert to angular)

----------------

add cookies checkbox to history/favorite modal, can save/load cookies or remove them (use jscookie)
add cookies checkbox for settings to remember settings or reset them?
edge/ie copy buttons in history/favorites don't work. hide them with js?
make sure PWA remembers previous color and restores it on load
custom css scrollbar?
speak color? with delay?
night mode?
show number of history/favorites? undo clear/remove?
show all web colors in modal, like favs/history where you can open and share them (just not delete)
color mixer?
display color formulas?
choose stored color mode (not always in hex) so conversion isn't messed up and numbers can always be increased/decreased
