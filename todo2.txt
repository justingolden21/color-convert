TODO
organize js and css files

look into colors being slightly different and getting adjusted by setColor()

test history/favorites more

look into bugs with color picker not updating (text color and inputs, callback func)

work on info about color modes next (or convert to angular)

----------------

add cookies checkbox to history/favorite modal, can save/load cookies or remove them (use jscookie)
edge/ie copy buttons in history/favorites don't work. hide them with js?
make sure PWA remembers previous color and restores it on load
custom css scrollbar?
speak color? with delay?
night mode?
show number of history/favorites? undo clear/remove?
